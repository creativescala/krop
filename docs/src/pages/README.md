# Krop

Krop is a Scala 3 web framework. Its goal is to make it delightful to build delightful web applications. It supports every kind of web application, from fast and scalable APIs to rich user experiences. It excels at projects where productivity and feature richness are a priority. See [our principles](overview/principles.md) for more.

## Getting Started

The fastest way to start with Krop is using the template project, which is described in the [Quick Start](quick-start.md).

If you want to add Krop to an existing project, add the following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.creativescala" %% "krop-core" % "@VERSION@"
```
