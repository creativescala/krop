# Krop

Krop is a Scala 3 web framework. It's can handle any web application, from APIs to rich user experiences, but it excels at projects where productivity and feature richness are a priority. For more, see [our principles](overview/principles.md).


## Getting Started

The fastest way to start with Krop is using the template project, which is described in the [Quick Start](quick-start.md).

If you want to add Krop to an existing project, add the following to your `build.sbt`

```scala
libraryDependencies += "org.creativescala" %% "krop-core" % "@VERSION@"
```

## ScalaDoc

See the ScalaDoc @:api(krop.index) for API documentation.
